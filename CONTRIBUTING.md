#### Local development
To develop stuff for the website, you might want to run it locally to check your changes. This is possible. To run Amélie locally, follow these steps:

##### Install required packages
To develop for Amélie, the following packages are needed:

###### Windows
Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

###### Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install python3 libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev xmlsec1 libssl-dev libldap-dev libsasl2-dev

###### Arch linux
    sudo pacman -Syu python libjpeg-turbo zlib xmlsec openssl

##### Clone the website
    git clone https://github.com/Inter-Actief/amelie.git
    cd amelie/

##### Setup a virtualenv
    virtualenv ./venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt

##### Copy local settings
    cp ./amelie/settings/local.py.localdev ./amelie/settings/local.py

##### Change settings (`MEDIA_ROOT` locations)
Replace the `MEDIA_ROOT` and `DATA_EXPORT_ROOT` settings with proper locations. This location will be used to store uploaded files.

    nano ./amelie/settings/local.py

For example: *(make sure the directory exists!)*

    MEDIA_ROOT = "/tmp/amelie_uploads"

##### Populate the database
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py www_generate_dummydata --ok

##### Run the development server
    python manage.py runserver

#### Working on issues
When working on an issue or feature, please work on a feature branch (or a fork). For example:

    git branch feature-new-homepage
    git checkout feature-new-homepage

    git branch issue-830
    git checkout issue-830
